title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a research scientist in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].

I'm working with the [Climate Modeling Alliance] (CliMA) to build a
new, trainable climate model with quantified uncertainty.

My work aims both to better understand the world, and to improve the fidelity of ocean and climate simulations.
I study turbulence and mixing, waves, near-surface processes, and the approximate representation of ocean and sea ice processes in numerical simulations.
I also lead the development of CliMA's [ocean component](ClimaOcean), CliMA's [sea ice component](ClimaSeaIce),
and the ground-breaking ocean modeling software they are based on, [Oceananigans].
Oceananigans is written for GPUs in the high-level [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/): highly productive, easy to develop, and 10-50x faster than existing software.
