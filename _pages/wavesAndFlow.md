Generated by winds and tides and borne on the density gradients 
and the rotation of the earth, giant interior waves traverse the oceans. 
These 'internal waves' control Earth's climate by breaking and turbulently
mixing heat and carbon into the deep ocean, alter the trajectory of currents
and eddies, and even slow the Earth's rotation by drawing energy
from tides.

More coming soon.
