The density stratification and carbon content of the abyssal ocean is set
by an equilibration between the formation of cold, salty bottom water
in polar winters and mixing between this water and warmer, fresher waters 
above by turbulence on millimeter to meter scales. The implication of this
story is astounding: basically, the ocean and climate of Earth is 
inextricably linked to ocean-churning turbulence on the smallest of scales.

Squeeze dispersion is a way through which large-scale ocean eddies and 
currents interact --- motions on 10 to 100 km scales --- interact with 
small-scale turbulence to *enhance* the rate at which things like heat
and carbon mix in the vertical and into the abyssal ocean. We're calling this
process *squeeze disperion* because it has to do with how eddies and currents
squeeze (and stretch) fluid surfaces.
