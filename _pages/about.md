I research the Earth's ocean, its physics and motion, and
its entangled eddies, turbulence, currents, and waves.
I do a lot of math and write code that runs on supercomputers.
In the distant past, I went to [sea].
I love to learn and to teach, to think about past and future, and to 
run, climb, ski, and explore the landscapes of Earth.

**Long ago**, I grew up in a [Boston suburb][wellesley]. 
Later, I studied Aerospace Engineering, combustion, space propulsion,
and wind energy at the University of Michigan before moving to San Diego to pursue a PhD at UCSD in 2010.
I worked with [Eric Lauga] and [Bill Young] on bugs and waves until receiving a PhD for a 
[dissertation] titled 
[*On the coupled evolution of oceanic internal waves and quasi-geostrophic flow*][proquest] in May 2016.
Along the way, I fell in love with [running], [climbing], [backcountry skiing], and [surfing].
I moved to Boston in 2017 for a postdoc with [Raf Ferrari] at [MIT] funded by a [NOAA fellowship][NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship],
before joining the [Climate Modeling Alliance] as an MIT research scientist in 2019.
In 2020, Leah and I climbed [our first multipitch route](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106511942/endeavor) together.
