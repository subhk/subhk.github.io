Hello! I’m Subhajit Kar, a Ph.D. candidate in Physical Oceanography at Tel Aviv University’s School of Geosciences. I spend my days running high-resolution computer models that peel back the ocean’s “surface layer” to reveal the energetic world of submesoscale fronts, internal waves, and the instabilities that bind them together. These fast, kilometer-scale processes might seem tiny on a global map, yet they shape how heat, carbon, and nutrients move from the upper few hundred meters into the deep sea—ultimately steering climate and marine ecosystems alike.
